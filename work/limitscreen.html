                <h2>Limit Screen</h2>
                <h3>UX/UI</h3>
                <p>The project was born in response to the surge in teleworking, as indicated by the data from the survey on the active population conducted by the Banco de España, there has been a notable increase in companies adopting remote working practices. Comparing statistics from the pre-pandemic year 2019 with subsequent years during and post-pandemic, the increase was substantial, going from 8.3% in 2019 to an impressive 80%. This surge was documented in an in-depth study focused on the implementation of teleworking in Spain.
                    At the same time, an increase in health problems and symptoms associated with prolonged sedentary behavior has been observed, such as visual fatigue, microtraumas to bones and muscles, and muscle fatigue, among others. Given that a standard working day in Spain typically lasts 8 hours, equivalent to approximately 1642 hours of work per year per employee, it becomes essential to support a system that promotes healthy habits. The project was therefore created to promote a balanced approach to remote working to mitigate the health problems and sedentary nature often linked to this way of working, ensuring that workers develop effective and health-conscious strategies to manage their work responsibilities from home. The app guarantees essential, customizable exercises, depending on the location of the ailments caused by sedentary work, such as the back, neck and neck. etc..
